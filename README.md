# Pixugo

Pixugo is a scalable gamified productivity web application built as a learning-focused
project with production-ready architecture in mind.

The goal of Pixugo is to make productivity more engaging by combining task management
with game mechanics such as points, levels, and achievements.

This project is developed gradually and maintained as a long-term portfolio and
open-source project.
